# Registration Site

 To Do:
 Email validation - don't use popups
 breadcrumb images
 generate / send email
 give feedback on duplicate registration
 fix UI issues - image too large, "footer" area too small, not docked bottom
 Styling (red) for invalid input controls not working
 text box layout within table - strecth to fit full width

 # For consideration
